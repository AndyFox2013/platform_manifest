Beer Gang Project
================

To start, make a lovely folder to sync into. We tend to use:

    mkdir BeerGanging && cd BeerGanging
    
Then you need to initialize your local repo. Use this command:
    
    repo init -u git://github.com/BeerGangProject/platform_manifest.git -b jellybean
    
Then sync up:

    repo sync
    
    
Don't worry more will come. How to add device support etc.
